# Welcome to Intel速 SecL-DC

Hardware-based cloud security solutions provide a higher level of protection as compared to software-only security measures. There are many Intel platform security technologies, which can be used to secure customers' data. Customers have found adopting and deploying these technologies at a broad scale challenging, due to the lack of solution integration and deployment tools. Intel速 Security Libraries for Data Centers (Intel速 SecL - DC) was built to aid our customers in adopting and deploying Intel Security features, rooted in silicon, at scale.

Intel速 SecL-DC is an open-source remote attestation implementation comprising of a set of building blocks that utilize Intel Security features to discover, attest, and enable critical foundation security and confidential computing use-cases. It applies the remote attestation fundamentals and standard specifications to maintain a platform data collection service and an efficient verification engine to perform comprehensive trust evaluations. These trust evaluations can be used to govern different trust and security policies applied to any given workload.
