# Build

## Secure Key Caching

Note: currently, the repos contain the source code of both the SGX Attestation Infrastructure and SKC. Make will build and package all the binaries and installation scripts  but the SGX Attestation Infrastructure can be installed and deployed separately. SKC cannot be installed without the SGX Attestation Infrastructure. 

The rest of this document will indicate steps that are only needed for SKC. 

**Pulling Source Code**

```
mkdir -p /root/workspace && cd /root/workspace
repo init -u https://github.com/intel-secl/build-manifest.git -b refs/tags/v3.3.1 -m manifest/skc.xml
repo sync
```

**Install, Enable and start the Docker daemon**

  ```shell
  dnf install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.2.10-3.2.el7.x86_64.rpm
  dnf install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-cli-19.03.13-3.el7.x86_64.rpm
  dnf install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-19.03.13-3.el7.x86_64.rpm
  systemctl enable docker
  systemctl start docker
  ```

**Ignore the below steps if not running behind a proxy**

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
  touch /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/proxy.conf
  
  #Add the below lines in proxy.conf and set proxy server details if proxy is used
  [Service]
  Environment="HTTP_PROXY=<http_proxy>"
  Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=<https_proxy>"
  Environment="NO_PROXY=<no_proxy>"
  ```

  ```shell
  #Reload docker
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart docker
  ```

**Building All SKC Components**

```
make

```

**Copy Binaries to a clean folder**

```
For CSP/Enterprise Deployment Model, copy the generated binaries directory to the /root directory on the CSP/Enterprise system
For Single system model, copy the generated binaries directory to the /root directory on the deployment system
```
